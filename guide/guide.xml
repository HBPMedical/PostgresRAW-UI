<doc>&lt;p&gt;This is the demo mode.
We're going to walk through a number of queries to illustrate
the syntax of Qrawl and show its capabilities. The code is going to be
inserted in the editor below, feel free to edit it yourself to try things
out. Let's start with a regular SQL like select statement (click next)&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
</step>
<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;This is listing the various fields of the records stored in the
people table. Since people are described by their year of birth, name
and job, we'd like to perform now a couple of regular SQL aggregations.&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select * from people
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;Here we group people by year and count the number of people in each
group.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select year, count(*)
from people
group by year
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;Here we group people by job and report the maximum year of each
group. All this is regular SQL. In Qrawl however, it is possible to
process the grouped data as a collection, without explicitly performing
a numeric aggregation on it.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select job, count(*)
from people
group by job
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;By removing the aggregator, we have now the actual collection of
people matching the job nested in each row.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select job, *
from people
group by job
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;In Qrawl, this statement permits to split a collection in groups.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select *
from people
group by job
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;If willing to operate on that collection, one should use the keyword
&lt;code&gt;partition&lt;/code&gt; in a from. The keyword partition refers to the group of people
which matched the job. From there on, one can perform arbitrary queries
on the subset, including splitting it in groups.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select job, select year
            from partition
from people
group by job
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;If willing to operate on that collection, one should use the keyword
partition in a from. The keyword partition refers to the group of people
which matched the job.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select job, select year, *
            from partition // partition = the people with that job
            group by year  // '*' is the subset of people having that year
from people
group by job
</query>
</step>

<step>
<doc>&lt;p&gt;Here we do a couple more aggregations.
&lt;/p&gt;</doc>
<query>
select job, select year, (select name from partition) as names,
                   count(*) as size
            from partition group by year,
            count(*) as all // the 'count' of people with that job
from people
group by job
</query>
</step>
